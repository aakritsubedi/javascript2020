          <span class="h5">What are data structures</span>
          <p>
            A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data
            in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
            More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the
            relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can
            be applied to the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply the data structure, at high level, are techniques for storing
            and organizing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and
            access. Data structures determine how data is collected, the
            functions we can use to access it, and the relationships between
            data.

          <p>Data structures enable us to:</p>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>Manage and utilize large datasets</li>
            <li>Search for particular data from a database</li>
            <li>Simplify and speed up data processing</li>
            <li>
              Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Data structures are vital for efficient, real-world problem solving.
            After all, the way we organize data has a lot of impact on
            performance and useability.
          </p>
          <p>JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures.</p>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>
              <b>Primitive data structures</b> and data types are native to the
              programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Non-primitive data structures</b> are not defined by the
              programming language but rather by the programmer. These include
              linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data
              structures, like queue and linked lists. The concept to handle a
              large amount of data that are complex and connected is called
              abstract data structure.

          <span class="h4">Importance and Advantages</span>
          <p>
            A right selection of data structure can enhance the efficiency of
            computer program or algorithm in a better way.
          </p>
          <span class="h5">Why Data Structures are needed</span>
          <p>
            With increasing complexities in computer algorithms, the amount of
            data usage is increasing, this can affect the performance of the
            application and can create some areas of concern.
          </p>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>
              <b>Processing speed: </b> To handle very large data, high-speed
              processing is required, but with growing data processor may fail
              to achive required processing speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data Search: </b> Getting a particular record from database
              should be quick and with optimum use of resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Multiple requests: </b> To handle simultanous requests from
              multiple users.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In order to work on concern areas, data structures are used. Data is
            organized to form a data structure in such a way that all items are
            not required to be searched and required data can be searched
            instantly.
          </p>
          <span class="h5">Data Structure Advantages</span>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>
              <b>Efficient Memory use:</b> With efficient use of data structure
              memory usage can be optimized, for e.g we can use linked list vs
              arrays when we are not sure about the size of data. When there is
              no more use of memory, it can be released.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reusability:</b> Data structures can be reused, i.e. once we
              have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any
              other place. Implementation of data structures can be compiled
              into libraries which can be used by different clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Abstraction:</b> Data structure serves as the basis of abstract
              data types, the data structure defines the physical form of
              ADT(Abstract Data Type). ADT is theoretical and Data structure
              gives physical form to them.

            The most basic of all data structures, an array stores data in
            memory for later use. Each array has a fixed number of cells decided
            on its creation, and each cell has a corresponding numeric index
            used to select its data. Whenever you’d like to use the array, all
            you need are the desired indices, and you can access any of the data
            within.

            Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in
            which the operations are performed. The order may be
            <b>LIFO</b>(Last In First Out) or <b>FILO</b>(First In Last Out).

          <p>
            Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the
            canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be
            removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost
            position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it
            can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In
            Last Out) order.

          <p>
            A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in
            which the operations are performed. The order is <b>FIFO</b>(First
            In First Out) .
          </p>
          <p>
            Queues are conceptually similar to stacks; both are sequential
            structures, but queues process elements in the order they were
            entered rather than the most recent element. As a result, queues can
            be thought of as a FIFO (First In, First Out) version of stacks.
            These are helpful as a buffer for requests, storing each request in
            the order it was received until it can be processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack
            we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove
            the item the least recently added.

            For a visual, consider a single-lane tunnel: the first car to enter
            is the first car to exit. If other cars should wish to exit, but the
            first stops, all cars will have to wait for the first to exit before
            they can proceed.

          <p>
            Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
          </p>
          <p>
            A linked list is a common data structure made of a chain of nodes in which each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain. The head pointer points to the first node, and the last element of the list points to null. When the list is empty, the head pointer points to null.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linked lists can dynamically increase in size and it is easy to insert and delete from a linked list because unlike arrays, we only need to change the pointers of the previous element and the next element to insert or delete an element.
          </p>
          <p>
            A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.
