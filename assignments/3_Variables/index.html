      <h2>Variables in JS</h2>
      <p>
        A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store
        goodies, visitors, and other data.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a variable in JavaScript, use the <code>let</code> or
        <code>var</code> keyword. The let and var are reserved keywords to
        declare a variable. A variable must have unique name and assigned value
        using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.  we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:
      </p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="variable-syntax"></span>
      <b>Examples:</b>
      <span class="code-editor" id="variable-examples"></span>
      <p>The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="accessing-variable"></span>
      <p>We can also declare multiple variables in one line:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="multiple-declaration"></span>
      <b>Note: </b>
      <p>It is Not Recommended to declare a variable without var/let keyword. It can accidently overwrite an existing global variable.</p>
      <br>
      <span class="h5">Examples: </span>
      <p>We can also change it as many times as we want. When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable. </p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="example1"></span>
      <p>We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="example2"></span>
      <br>
      <span class="h4">The old "var"</span>
      <p>In the very first chapter about variables, we mentioned three ways of variable declaration:</p>
      <ul class="pl-5">
        <li>let</li>
        <li>const</li>
        <li>var</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The var declaration is similar to let. Most of the time we can replace let by var or vice-versa and expect things to work:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="let-var-example"></span>
      <p>But internally var is a very different beast, that originates from very old times. It’s generally not used in modern scripts.</p>
      <span class="h5">“var” has no block scope</span>
      <p>Variables, declared with var, are either function-wide or global. They are visible through blocks.</p>
      <b>For Example:</b>
      <span class="code-editor" id="var-scope"></span>
      <p>As var ignores code blocks, we’ve got a global variable test.</p>
      <p>If we used let test instead of var test, then the variable would only be visible inside if:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="let-scope"></span>
      <p>The same thing for loops: var cannot be block- or loop-local:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="loop-scope"></span>
      <p>If a code block is inside a function, then var becomes a function-level variable:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="function-scope"></span>
      <span class="h5">“var” tolerates redeclarations</span>
      <p>If we declare the same variable with let twice in the same scope, that’s an error:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="let-redeclaration"></span>
      <p>With var, we can redeclare a variable any number of times. If we use var with an already-declared variable, it’s just ignored:</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="var-redeclaration"></span>
      <b>Note: </b>
      <p>Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not.</p>
      <br>
      <span class="h5">Constant in JS</span>
      <p>To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let. Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error. </p>
      <p>Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.</p>
      <span class="code-editor" id="constant-example"></span>

      <span class="h4">Summary</span>
      <ul class="pl-4">
        <li>We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.</li>
        <ul class="pl-5">
          <li>let – is a modern variable declaration.</li>
          <li>var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all.</li>
          <li>const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>There are two main differences of var compared to let/const:</li>
        <ul class="pl-5">
          <li>var variables have no block scope, they are visible minimum at the function level.</li>
          <li>var declarations are processed at function start (script start for globals).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Case matters: Variables named apple and AppLE are two different variables. Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.</li>
