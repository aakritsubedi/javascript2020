      <h2>Least Common Factor</h2>
      <p>
        In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.

      <span class="h5 d-block">For example:</span>
      <span class="d-block h6">What is the LCM of 4 and 6?</span>
      <p>
        Multiples of 4 are: 
        <code class="d-block">4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        and multiple of 6 are: 
        <code class="d-block">6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...</code>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Common multiples of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:
        <code class="d-block">12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....</code>
      </p>
      <p>So, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers <code>4 and 6</code>, their least common multiple is <b>12</b>.</p>
      <span class="d-block h5">Computing the least common multiple</span>
      <p>
        The following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:
      </p>
      <code class="d-block"><b>lcm(a, b)</b> = |a * b| / gcd(a, b)</code>
