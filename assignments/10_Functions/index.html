          <p>
            Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a
            specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and
            "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over
            and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside
            of other functions.
          </p>
          <p>To create a function we can use a function declaration in JS.</p>

          <p>The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function, then a list of parameters between the parentheses (comma-separated) and finally the code of the function, also named “the function body”, between curly braces.</p>

          <span class="h5">Variable Rules</span>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.</li>
            <li>A function can access an outer variable as well and also it can modify it as well.</li>
            <li>The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one. If a same-named variable is declared inside the function then it shadows the outer one.</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="code-editor" id="function-variable"></span>
          <b>Note: </b>
          <p>Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer, are called global. Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals). It’s a good practice to <u>minimize the use of global variables</u>. Modern code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their functions. Sometimes though, they can be useful to store project-level data.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <span class="h5">Parameters</span>
          <p>A parameter or a formal argument, is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <span class="h5">Default Value</span>
          <p>If a parameter is not provided, then its value becomes undefined.  A parameter has a default value of undefined. It means that if you don't pass the arguments into the function, its parameters will have the default values of undefined .</p>
          <p>That’s not an error. There’s no value, so it’s assumed that value becomes undefined. If we want to use a “default” text in this case, then we can specify it after equal to(=).</p>
          <span class="code-editor" id="func-default-value"></span>
          <p>To check for an omitted parameter, we can compare it with undefined or could use the || operator</p>
          <span class="code-editor" id="func-default-alternate"></span>
          <br>
          <p>Modern JavaScript engines support the <code>nullish coalescing operator <b>??</b></code>, it’s better when falsy values, such as 0, are considered regular:</p>

          <span class="h5">Returning a value</span>
          <p>A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.</p>
          <span class="code-editor" id="func-return"></span>
          <p>It is possible to use return without a value. That causes the function to exit immediately. If a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns undefined. </p>
          <span class="code-editor" id="empty-return"></span>
          <b>Note: </b>
          <p>Never add a newline between return and the value. That doesn’t work, because JavaScript assumes a semicolon after return statement.</p>

          <span class="h5">Naming a function</span>
          <p>
            Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.
          </p>
          <p>Function starting with…</p>
          <ul class="pl-5">
            <li>"show..." – display something</li>
            <li>"get…" – return a value</li>
            <li>"calc…" – calculate something</li>
            <li>"create…" – create something</li>
            <li>"check…" – check something and return a boolean</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it returns.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mt-3">
        <span class="h5">Good Practice to follow</span>
        <ul class="pl-5">
          <li>
            <b>One function – one action</b>
            <p>
              A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more. Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together. 
            </p>
            <p>Functions should be short and do exactly one thing. If that thing is big, maybe it’s worth it to split the function into a few smaller functions. Sometimes following this rule may not be that easy, but it’s definitely a good thing. </p>
            <b>Note: </b> A separate function is not only easier to test and debug – its very existence is a great comment!
            <span class="code-editor" id="break-function"></span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Function naming</b>
            <p>Generally functions names should be concise and descriptive.</p>
          </li>

        <br>
        <li>Function Structure</li>
        <ul class="pl-5">
          <li>Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables</li>
          <li>A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn’t see its local variables</li>
          <li>A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined</li>
        </ul>
        <li>To make the code clean and easy to understand, it’s recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters in the function, not outer variables</li>
        <li>Function Naming</li>
        <ul class="pl-5">
          <li>A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns</li>
          <li>A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal</li>
          <li>There exist many well-known function prefixes like create…, show…, get…, check… and so on. Use them to hint what a function does</li>
